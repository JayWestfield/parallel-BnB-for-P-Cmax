startup (sorting filling ret etc) do asnc / in parallel

might recompute the irrelevance index on lowerBound update, but not sure 

run more heuristics for a better upper bound and use one thread etc to compute a better lower bound because they are crucial

TODO error handling for adding a gist that has makespan > upperbound (due to boundUpdate) => memory conflicts


Debugging Question:

there the programm does not continue 
wait for tasks to finish 192 239 281  => 9 5 2  Job: 8

both children:
child from recursion 248 239 281  => 4 3 2  Job: 9 
this has a gist  2 239 248 281  => 4 3 2  Job: 9

child from recursion 192 295 281  => 6 2 1  Job: 9
this has a gist  2 192 281 295  => 6 2 1  Job: 9

(no third child because 56 + 281 = 337 > 318 current upper Bound)
but the taskgroup does not resume why

last bound update in line 14443

reason for a delayed task add Prev 42 15 2
