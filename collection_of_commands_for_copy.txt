compiler unroll => 



1. parallelisiere den startup (lowprio)
2. find a better concurrent hashmap
3. the shared lock in the ST takes some time even with the try lock () also the unlock and the one from the BnB_base
4. deeper look into addPrviously (ther is currently some loggin) include that in the plots etc?
5. give a nother datastructure a try for the state propose kind of a list where we  save the index instead of the pointer ( and maybe the )
6. rule for the same jobsize is not implemented yet ( would be easier with point 5)
7. branchless fillRet?
8. lower bonding techiniques
9. for states with only one follow up state no need to copy the state (fe FUR) but be really careful 
10. increase startup a bit by directly starting with solve partial not with 0 0 0 ... but with assigning the first few jobs (all the possibilities [don't do to meuich here but maybe the first 3 jobs])
11. remove logging ( that somehow sill takes time even though jump prediction should do quite well here)

TODO why do i need to lock the eist on bound update see this p_cmax-class6-n54-m24-minsize54-maxsize216-seed15421.txt
p_cmax-class6-n54-m24-minsize54-maxsize216-seed15421.txt
p_cmax-class6-n36-m16-minsize36-maxsize144-seed4929.txt   should be 2017
fioxed by first clearing st before offset/bound

spurious error:
